> Litekart is a Javascript ecommerce software that focus mainly on speed and ease of use. It is built over the cutting edge technology and purely modular code.

## What is Litekart?

Litekart is a framework designed to give you a strong architecture following official Nuxt guidelines. Incrementally adoptable, it can be used to create from grocery ecommerce to fashion commerce to complex enterprise ready ecommerce applications.

This is based on ReST API and disconnected architecture. Hence you are free to use any front-end or backend. For the same reason I separated both store front and store back office. Now you are free to use any ecommerce service like Moltin or even Firebase.

This has the potential to be converted to any type of ecommerce from Fashion Store, Electronics, Grocery Store with a little customizations
